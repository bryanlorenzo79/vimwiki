>i was trying to rename a playlist from a youtube channel(brocode) to curate
>some programming tutorials. the youtube downloader app(yt-dlp) downloaded the
>video that includes special character from a file name. when i do a ls command
>from the terminal, it isn't sorted according to the sequence it was intended
>to watch. fortunately, the ls command has a flag to sort the files of when
>the file was created. i just had to rename those files with a number in front
>so when i do a ls command, it's easier to read it.

>I initially have the keyboard shortcut for autoclosing brackets and parenthesis
>by typing the open bracket and parenthesis first. Overtime, I was having a 
>difficult time typing the less than sign alone since it is one of those 
>characters with shortcut for autoclosing and heavily used in html code. My 
>solution for that was having the comma key pressed and then the bracket or
>parenthesis keys. In doing so, I can just use the less than or greater sign
>conventionally without having it autoclose like previous method and delete the
>unneccesary key. But then over time and gaining more time coding, I use the
>greater than or less than sign to a lesser degree than autoclosing brackets
>and parenthesis. The next iteration of this should be autoclosing the brackets
>and parenthesis without the comma since it's an added step and use the comma to
>use the greater than and less than sign character to type those characters.
