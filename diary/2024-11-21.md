I can't say that I am fully recovered from last week. I just had a fever and 
was coughing. But I did manage to take a long early walk. I was able to buy 
some 'palitaw'for P15 each. Bought 3 pieces. Seeing the ocean at the boulevard 
for quiet some time gave me time to medidate. Getting back home my feet started 
to hurt. I think I might have some blister.
