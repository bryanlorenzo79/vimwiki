:fleeting:vim:autoclose:snippets:
I initially have the keyboard shortcut for autoclosing brackets and parenthesis
by typing the open bracket and parenthesis first. Overtime, I was having a 
difficult time typing the less than sign alone since it is one of those 
characters with shortcut for autoclosing and heavily used in html code. My 
solution for that was having the comma key pressed and then the bracket or
parenthesis keys. In doing so, I can just use the less than or greater sign
conventionally without having it autoclose like previous method and delete the
unneccesary key. But then over time and gaining more time coding, I use the
greater than or less than sign to a lesser degree than autoclosing brackets
and parenthesis. The next iteration of this should be autoclosing the brackets
and parenthesis without the comma since it's an added step and use the comma to
use the greater than and less than sign character to type those characters.
