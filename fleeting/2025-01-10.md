:linux:terminal:mv:ls:
i was trying to rename a playlist from a youtube channel(brocode) to curate
some programming tutorials. the youtube downloader app(yt-dlp) downloaded the
video that includes special character from a file name. when i do a ls command
from the terminal, it isn't sorted according to the sequence it was intended
to watch. fortunately, the ls command has a flag to sort the files of when
the file was created. i just had to rename those files with a number in front
so when i do a ls command, it's easier to read it.

:pizza:test:
need to figure out how to slow down the proofing.
