:conduction: - heat energy is transferred by the collision of molecules or
other particles.
:convection: - transfer of heat energy by the physical movement of a fluid -
which in engineering, can be liquid or a gas.
:radiation: - is a transfer of heat energy in the form of electromagnetic
waves - any electromagnetic waves, not just the cancer-causing kind. Reflective
surface minimize heat transfer.

in 1816, the 26 year old Robert Sterling invented the sterling engine in 
Scotland. Recently, Chinese scientist have further develop the sterling engine.
Specifically, the thermoacoustic sterling engine. High-pressure helium at
15 megapascals serves as the working medium(more than 30 times the pressure of
a bicycle tire).
