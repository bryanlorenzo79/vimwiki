:birds:lungs:
bird lung are more effecient than mammals/humans. when they inhale and then
exhale, it doesn't go through the same way. it goes through another air sac
before air is released. it's a one way valve unlike humans we're it's a two
way valve. The air that goes into the lungs go the same pipe to go out. birds
does this because they can extract 100% of the oxygen in the air and thus 
delivering more oxygen to the blood stream making them not gasp for air when
they are flying at high altitude(thin air). there was an incident were a bird
was injured and its wing was so bad that the bone protruded. when a somebody
saw this particular bird, he did the most human thing to do and tried to drown
it. to his surprise, the bird didn't die because the bird's lung is so effecient
that they can actually breadth from the protruding bone. like snorkling.
