:data_structure:
data structure - a named location that can be used to store and organize data.
(ie. family tree, array)

:algorithm:
algorithm - a collection of steps to solve a problem

why learn data structure and algorithms?
1. You'll write code that is both time and memory effecient.
2. Commonly asked questions involve DS&A in coding interviews.


:stack_data_structure:
stack - LIFO data structure. Last-in First-out stores objects in a sort of
"vertical tower" (ie. stack of books, cds, games etc.)
push() to add to the top
pop() to remove from the top

uses of stack?
1. undo/redo features in text editors
2. moving back/forward through browser history
3. backtracking algorithm (maze, file directoris)
4. calling functions (call stack)

:js_pop:
pop() - removes the last value in an array.
Doing a pop() method on an empty array does not give out an error in js.
You can store the pop() value in an array by assigning it to a variable.
(ie. let someValue = array1.pop())
