:vertical:farming:
vertical farming are failing because of not turning profit due to high cost of
maintaining the facility(energy cost). Average consumer would not want to buy
the same lettuce for twice the price of a traditional farming method. But 
vertical farming is a viable solution for countries that doesn't have a year 
round climate for farming.(ie. Canada have long winters)
