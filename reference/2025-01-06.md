creating multiple dhcp server
1. IP/Addresses - add a unique ip address other than the one that is currently used (ie 192.168.89.1/24, 10.0.0.1/24) and assign it to a bridge(ie bridge2 if bridged1 is already used).
2. IP/IP Pool - add a pool of ip address for this network. Addresses must be in range (ie 192.168.89.20-192.168.89.40).
3. IP/DHCP Server - create another dhcp server. Address pool should be the newly created pool of ranged addresses from step 2. Interface should be the same bridge used in step 1.
4. IP/DHCP Server - go to the network tab and add a new network. Address should be 192.168.89.0/24 ang Gateway should be 192.168.89.1 with a Netmask of 24.
